Hello there,
<br/><br/>
A friend of yours just shared the Smiles &amp; Frowns&trade; rewards chart app with you. We hope that means your friend really likes it, and we hope you like it, too!
<br/><br/>
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smiles-frowns/id1058499314?ls=1&mt=8">Get it on the app store.</a>
<br/><br/>
Smiles &amp; Frowns is a true mom and pop story. Tinkering with our own rewards chart at home led us to an approach we started calling our "5 Cs of Positive Reinforcement&trade;": Clarity, Consistency, Collaboration, Consequence and a game-like sense of Challenge. And that led to some great features you won't find anywhere else, like:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Great premade boards that are well thought out and easy to customize</li>
<li>A simple formula that lets kids create their own rewards-buying power</li>
<li>A simple way to set rewards based on Money, Time, Treats or Goals</li>
<li>The ability to invite spouses and other guardians to join your board</li>
<li>An easy way to review performance and even export a PDF of results</li>
<li>Automatic synching between devices</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Please check out the app when you can. If you want to know more about Smiles &amp; Frowns, come visit at us at <a href="http://www.smilesandfrowns.com">http://www.smilesandfrowns.com</a>.
