Hey there –

I’m sending this to share the Smiles & Frowns™ rewards chart app with you. The people who made it were even kind enough to write this email for me…
Nice folks, right?

Here’s the AppStore link:

Smiles & Frowns is all about making great behavior charts easy. It’s got pre-built boards to get going fast, rewards that are easy to set, and a totally unique way to invite spouses, relatives, a nanny or even a babysitter to sync up with your board and help you manage the plan.

Am I liking it? Well, hey, I am sharing it…

Check it out – Smiles & Frowns!
